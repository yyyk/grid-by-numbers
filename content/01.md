### - Grid -

If someone asked me what computers are good at, I would say it's good at calculation and repetitive tasks with speed.

Based on this, I thought drawing by code would apply quite well in creating grids.

Swiss graphic designers have established swell ideas on systematic approaches even before computers became one of their tools, and published them.

To name a few:

- [Grid systems](https://www.niggli.ch/en/grid-systems-in-graphic-design.html) by [Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%C3%BCller-Brockmann)
- [Designing Programmes](https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/designing-programmes) by [Karl Gerstner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Gerstner)
- [Graphic Design Manual](https://www.niggli.ch/en/graphic-design-manual.html) by [Armin Hofmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Hofmann)

Instead of going through details of each book and replicating them in code, I started with a simple case.

#### A grid of 10 x 10

If I were to draw a grid of 10 rows and 10 columns in javascript, I would write:

```js
const width = 1000
const height = 1000
const numberOfCells = 10
const cellWidth = width / numberOfCells
const cellHeight = height / numberOfCells

for (let y = 0; y < numberOfCells; y++) {
  for (let x = 0; x < numberOfCells; x++) {
    const width = cellWidth
    const height = cellHeight
    const positionX = x * cellWidth
    const positionY = y * cellHeight
    drawRectangle(positionX, positionY, width, height) // this is an imaginary function to draw a rectangle
  }
}
```

and this would give me something like this:

<div>
  <Editor :hide-editor="true" :read-only="true" :compiled="true" :value="'size width 1000 height 1000\n\trepeat y from 0 to 10 do\n\t\trepeat x from 0 to 10 do\n\t\t\trectangle\n\t\t\t\twidth 100\n\t\t\t\theight 100\n\t\t\t\tpositionX x * 100\n\t\t\t\tpositionY y * 100\n\t\t\tend\n\t\tend\n\tend\nend'"></Editor>
</div>

The snippet above is rather simple, but if I look at it as if I knew nothing about programming, I would wonder what `const`, `for`, `let`, `y++`, `x++`, and `drawRectangle(positionX, positionY, width, height)` are.

Referring to the syntax of `Repeat` used in Design by Numbers

```
Repeat A 0 10
{
  // Statements
}
```

and `for` in [Ruby](www.ruby-lang.org) language,

```ruby
for num in 0..10 do
  # Statements
end
```

I thought a grid of 10 x 10 could be expressed as below (with a hope of better readability):

```
size width 1000 height 1000
  repeat y from 0 to 10 do
    repeat x from 0 to 10 do
      rectangle
        width 100
        height 100
        positionX x * 100
        positionY y * 100
      end
    end
  end
end
```
