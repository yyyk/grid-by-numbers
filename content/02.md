## Chapter 2

### - Programming Language -

I had neither designed a programming language nor known how to make one. I went to an engineering school but wasn't in the computer science department. I needed to learn how to write an interpreter or compiler from scratch. Where would I start? Googling.

And it led me to a book called [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). I knew that I would write in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and would want the output data to be some kind of [json](https://www.json.org) that holds an array of geometry data like width, height, position, and so on. So, even without the knowledge of [Go](https://golang.org/) language, I was able to follow the book and apply the learnings to my needs (the book itself is well written too).

Prior to reading the book, I listed the features I would like to implement:

- basic arithmetic operations
- variable declaration and assignment with scope
- comparison and logical operations
- `if` statement
- `repeat` statement like `for` statement
- `size` function to set the overall size of the grid
- `rectangle` function to create each grid
- `group` function to group grids/rectangles
- less symbols and more words

The idea of `group` came from `<g>` element of [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/), although I hadn't decided whether I would use SVG or WebGL for the rendering at that time.

The last one in the list 'less symbols and more words' was meant that I wanted to avoid symbols like `(`, `{`, `&&`, and syntax like `if ((x > 0) && (y > 0)) {` or `for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {`. Rather, I wanted them to be like `if x > 0 and y > 0 then` or `repeat x from 0 to 10 do`, so that it's more comprehensible, even though it would require more typing.
