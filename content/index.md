## Introduction

I have always been fascinated by drawing tools, especially with the use of computers. Probably that's because I'm not good at drawing by hand.

A while back, I came across with John Maeda's [Design by Numbers](https://dbn.media.mit.edu/). That time, I didn't know how to code, so I didn't fully understand what it was but it gave me a slight idea of where design and coding could possibly meet.

Once I gained some experience in coding, I could see the possibility a little clearer and wanted to make something similar. I value drawing by hand as much as by code. Both has strength on its own. So, the first things I asked myself were what computer is better at and how I can apply that to design, and how to present it in the way that it's readable for anyone without requiring much knowledge of coding.
